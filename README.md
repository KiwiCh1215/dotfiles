# My dotfiles

Here are my local dotfiles mainly including

* i3gaps as wm
* vim as editor
* rofi as dmenu replacement
* dunst as notification deamon

Almost all graphical programs in this repo use Xresources.
Different color schemes and backgrounds may be available as tags. Those will most certainly also contain older versions of other files.
